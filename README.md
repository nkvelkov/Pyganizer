# Pyganizer

Repository for a desktop application that helps you organize and schedule with ease.


Basic functionality:
- adding an event in the list;
- removing an event from the list;
- the application should notify me about any event defined number of hours before an event takes place;

- adding tasks that need to be done;
- one should be able to select the priority of their tasks and add progress to each of the tasks;
- removing taks;
- a certain task remains in the todo list as long as it is not fully completed;
