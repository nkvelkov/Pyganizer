# Pyganizer

Repository for a desktop application that helps you organize and schedule with ease.


Basic functionality:
- adding an event in the list;
- removing an event from the list;
- the application should notify me about any event defined number of hours before an event takes place;

- adding tasks that need to be done before a particular deadline;
- one should be able to select the priority of their tasks and set the completeness rate of the different tasks;
- removing taks;
- the application should give me a notification when I am running out of time with a certain task;
